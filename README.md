# VaricellaGen
A comprehensive pipeline for the genomic analysis of Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the causative agent of chickenpox.

## About
VaricellaGen is a modular and automated pipeline designed to simplify and standardize the genomic analysis of Varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It integrates quality control, variant calling, consensus genome generation, de novo assembly, clade typing, mutation evaluation, and phylogenetic analysis into a streamlined workflow.

Key Features
Quality Control: Automated cleaning and filtering of raw sequencing reads to ensure data accuracy.
Variant Calling: Precise identification of SNPs and indels using GATK for enhanced genomic insights.
Consensus Genome Generation: Creation of high-quality reference-based genome assemblies for downstream analysis.
De Novo Assembly: Reconstruction of complete viral genomes without relying on a reference sequence.
Mutation Evaluation: Comprehensive assessment of mutations for functional and evolutionary insights.
Clade Typing: Efficient classification of VZV isolates into established clades.
Phylogenetic Analysis: Generation of robust phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining methods.

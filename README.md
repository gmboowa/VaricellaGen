# VaricellaGen
A comprehensive pipeline for the genomic analysis of Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the causative agent of chickenpox.

## About
VaricellaGen is a modular and automated pipeline designed to simplify and standardize the genomic analysis of Varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It integrates quality control, variant calling, consensus genome generation, de novo assembly, clade typing, mutation evaluation, and phylogenetic analysis into a streamlined workflow.


Key Features:

1. Quality Control: Automatically cleans and filters raw sequencing reads to ensure data accuracy.
2. Variant Calling: Accurately identifies SNPs and indels using GATK, providing enhanced genomic insights.
3. Consensus Genome Generation: Produces high-quality, reference-based genome assemblies for downstream analysis.
4. De Novo Assembly: Reconstructs complete viral genomes without relying on a reference sequence.
5. Mutation Evaluation: Provides a comprehensive assessment of mutations for functional and evolutionary insights.
6. Clade Typing: Rapidly classifies VZV isolates into established clades.
7. Phylogenetic Analysis: Generates robust phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining methods.

## üé¨ VaricellaGen
A comprehensive pipeline for the genomic analysis of Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the causative agent of chickenpox.

## üèÜ About
VaricellaGen is a modular and automated pipeline designed to simplify and standardize the genomic analysis of Varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It integrates quality control, variant calling, consensus genome generation, clade typing, and phylogenetic analysis into a streamlined workflow.


## üè∑Ô∏è Key Features:

1. Quality Control: Automatically cleans and filters raw sequencing reads to ensure data accuracy.
2. Variant Calling: Accurately identifies SNPs and indels using GATK, providing enhanced genomic insights.
3. Consensus Genome Generation: Produces high-quality, reference-based genome assemblies for downstream analysis.
4. Clade Typing: Rapidly classifies VZV isolates into established clades.
5. Phylogenetic Analysis: Generates robust phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining methods.

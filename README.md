# VaricellaGen
A comprehensive pipeline for Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) - the causative agent of Chicken pox genomic analysis.

## About
VaricellaGen is a modular and automated pipeline designed to simplify and standardize the genomic analysis of Varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It integrates quality control, variant calling, consensus genome generation, de novo assembly, clade typing, and phylogenetic analysis into a streamlined workflow.

## Key Features
- Quality Control: Automated cleaning and filtering of raw sequencing reads.
- Variant Calling: Accurate identification of SNPs and indels using GATK.
- Consensus Genome Generation: Production of high-quality reference-based genome assemblies.
- De Novo Assembly: Reconstruction of viral genomes without a reference.
- Mutation evaluation
- Clade Typing: Rapid classification of VZV isolates into known clades.
- Phylogenetic Analysis: Robust tree construction using maximum likelihood and neighbor-joining methods.
